# Animal-Classification-Machin-learning
A project for classification 10 category of animals


first of all download the the zip file from this link =>  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MPJ2q6DLCsIz2dtPvEITu96_NDvh6OVK?usp=sharing

put it inside of the project directory (beside of DataGathering.ipynb)

The steps of running project file is :

1. **DataGathering.ipynb**, Gathering image of animals in diffrect calsses
2. **Learning.ipynb**, Start Learning of our model built by TensorFlow
3. **Testing.ipynb**, It is for testing our model and visualizing the accuracy of it

After 80% accuracy, learning is automatically terminated by executing the **Call Back** command
