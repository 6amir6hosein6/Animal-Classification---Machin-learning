first of all download the the zip file from this link =>  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MPJ2q6DLCsIz2dtPvEITu96_NDvh6OVK?usp=sharing

put it inside of the project directory (beside of DataGathering.ipynb)

The steps of running project file is :

1. **DataGathering.ipynb**, Gathering image of animals in diffrect calsses
2. Learning.ipynb, Start Learning of our model built by TensorFlow
3. Testing.ipynb, It is for testing our model and visualizing the accuracy of it

After 80% accuracy, learning is automatically terminated by executing the **Call Back** command
